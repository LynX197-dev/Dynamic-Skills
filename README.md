# Dynamic Skills
## Created by LynX

Dynamic Skills is an innovative Minecraft plugin designed to deepen gameplay by allowing players to commit permanently to one of four distinct skill categories: Combat, Mining, Building, or Exploration. Each player selects their category upon first joining and embarks on a personalized 10-level roadmap that alternates between granting permanent, vanilla Minecraft effects and enchantments related strictly to their chosen category.

Progression in the roadmap depends on a weighted system: about 70% of advancement comes from earning vanilla Minecraft advancements relevant to the category, and about 30% from experience points gained by performing related activities. This combination ensures balanced, achievement-oriented gameplay that rewards meaningful effort rather than grinding.

## How the Roadmap Works

Players use a simple GUI resembling a progression roadmap, starting at level 1 and advancing to level 10. At each level, players choose between two mutually exclusive vanilla Minecraft effects or enchantments tailored to their category. Odd levels unlock potion-like effects, and even levels grant enchantments applicable to the tools, weapons, or armor the player uses. Once chosen, rewards are permanent and apply exclusively to the player, not to the items, guaranteeing that enchantments do not transfer when items are dropped or traded.

## Category Reward Details

### Combat Category
At level 1, players choose between Strength I, boosting melee damage, or Regeneration I, helping with health recovery. Level 2 presents a choice of Sharpness I, increasing weapon damage, or Protection I, improving armor defense. As they progress, they can pick Speed I or Resistance I to increase mobility or damage resistance at level 3, and Fire Aspect I or Thorns I for added fire damage or damage reflection at level 4. Levels 5 through 10 offer progressively stronger versions of these effects and enchantments—such as Strength III and Sharpness III—enhancing their PvP and combat prowess.

### Mining Category
Mining players begin with Haste I, speeding block breaking, or Night Vision I for better underground visibility. Level 2 offers Efficiency I, enhancing tool effectiveness, or Fortune I, increasing resource drops. Water Breathing I or upgraded Haste follows at level 3, while Unbreaking I or Mending I are choices at level 4 to improve tool durability and automatic repair. These beneficial effects and enchantments scale up to Haste V and Fortune III by level 10, supporting efficient mining and resource collection.

### Building Category
Builders choose at level 1 between Haste I to speed construction or Jump Boost I for improved vertical mobility. Level 2 offers Unbreaking I to prevent tool wear or Protection I to enhance defense. Fire Resistance and upgraded Haste become available around level 3, and Feather Falling or enhanced Protection appear at level 4. As they advance, players enjoy stronger iterations of these perks, encouraging longer, safer building sessions with better tool longevity and damage mitigation.

### Exploration Category
Explorers start with Speed I to traverse quickly or Night Vision I to see in low light at level 1. Feather Falling I to reduce fall damage or Depth Strider I to improve underwater movement appear at level 2. Water Breathing and enhanced Speed are unlocked by level 3, followed by Frost Walker to walk on water or higher Depth Strider levels at level 4. By the time they reach level 10, players possess high-tier effects and enchantments like Speed V and Depth Strider V, empowering survival and navigation in all biomes.

## Summary

Dynamic Skills merges Minecraft's authentic mechanics with deep, layerable skill specialization. It offers permanent, meaningful effect and enchantment rewards applied exclusively to the player, avoids transferable gear power, and uses vanilla advancements to ensure progression feels rewarding and impactful. The roadmap GUI simplifies tracking progress and solidifies player identity within their chosen category, making gameplay richer and more engaging on any server.

Perfect for servers seeking a balanced, achievement-driven skill system without custom enchantments or complex mods.
